Allows users to add links in a story using a shortcode to provide addition reading material about a subject.

== Description ==
Read More About allows users to add links in a story using a shortcode to provide addition reading material about a subject. Works great for large topics that can\'t all be explained in one post.

== Installation ==
1. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to \"Plugins\" -> \"Add New\" and search for \"Read More About\" and click install and activate.
2. To add related links for a post, go to the bottom post editor and click \"Add Link\" and fill out the fields for either an internal or external link.
3. To add the shortcode to the post, go to the top of the visual editor and click the button with the \"RM\" on the far right of the top row of buttons. To change the title of the related links section, fill out the title attribute. The float attribute accepts either left, right, center or none.

== Screenshots ==
1. The section to add related links to the post.
2. The position of the shortcode button in the visual editor.
3. The Read More About section in a post.
